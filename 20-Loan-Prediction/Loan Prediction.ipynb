    "# Predicting Loans\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will work with financial lending data from [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/) - a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. We will work with a dataset containing approved loans data from 2007 to 2011, since a good number of the loans have already finished. In the datasets for later years, many of the loans are current and still being paid off. Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Description of each column is available in the data dictionary stored on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/191B2yJ4H1ZPXq0_ByhUgWMFZOYem5jFz0Y3by_7YBY4/edit#gid=2081333097). The **LoanStats** sheet describes the approved loans datasets and the **RejectStats** describes the rejected loans datasets. We will focus on the approved loans only as they are available to investors. Since we are interested whether a loan will be paid on time or not, we will work only with the **LoanStats** sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "For learning purposes the size of the dataset has been reduced. Also some columns have been removed - `desc`, `url`, all columns with over 50% missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's tart by reading in the data."
