In this guided project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-89970a3b-182b-41ea-aea2-6f9f17b5907e/details?q=exit%20survey) and the survey for the DETE [here](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-qld-fe96ff30-d157-4a81-851d-215f2a0fe26d/details?q=exit%20survey).
